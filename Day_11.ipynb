ABOUT THIS MANUAL.\\n        ----------------------------\\n\\n   HELLO! My name\\'s Ratpouch, the real star of the game, and\\nat the very beginning of the game I\\'m very near to where\\nyou\\'re pacing around in your cell. Honest! I\\'m that close\\nthat I\\'m in spitting distance-which is very apt as i am the\\nsort of person who usually gets spat at, especially since\\nthe Skorl have come to town. They don\\'t care too much for my\\njokes and this is always getting me into trouble!\\n   The spitting i could take, but being stretched on ye\\nolde rack i just don\\'t find very amusing! Still I don\\'t want\\nto burden you with my troubles-though if you could somehow\\nrescue me i would be paternally grateful.\\n   I\\'d better explain what\\'s going on, and where you come\\nin, or i\\'ll be stuck here forever........\\n   Prepare to enter the village of Turnvale. Prepare\\nyourself for the experience known as virtual theatre!\\n\\nPage nine\\n---------\\n     SO WHAT\\'S THIS \"VIRTUAL THEATRE\" ALL ABOUT?\\n     -------------------------------------------\\n   It\\'s a very good question, and it\\'s one that hasn\\'t been\\nanswered before, because Lure of the Temptress is the first\\nvirtual theatre game ever written.\\n   Imagine for a moment that you are involved in a real life\\nscenario-you\\'re standing in a room which looks out, through\\na window, onto a village courtyard. Yes! A village courtyard\\nwith cobblestones. And let\\'s say that there are three people\\nstanding in the courtyard;Stuka,Python and Bagpuss.\\n If you were to look out of your window you might notice\\nthat Stuka and Python were having a conversation-about, how\\nmany Atari st owners it would take to change a lightbulb?\\nYou might also notice that Bagpuss, who is only interested\\nin not getting his long hair wet,and is not interested in\\nAtari owners, is sauntering towards the building that you\\nare in. Sure enough, he dissappears from the courtyard and\\n\"click\", the door to your right opens. In walks Bagpuss.\\nLet\\'s say that Bagpuss wants to talk to you, about hair wash\\nday or something, then you would turn to face him-as one\\nwould. Once your conversation with Bagpuss is over he turns\\naway from you and, with a flash of golden curls, exits\\nthrough the door, closing it behind him, and, you presume,\\nhas strolled back into the courtyard. So you look through\\nthe window to check and \"horror\" he isn\\'t there! Not a sign\\nof him. The courtyard is Bagpuss-less! Stuka and Python are\\nthere, waffling on about how two Atari st owners linked\\ntheir machines up and made a calculator, but Bagpuss is\\nnowhere to be seen. So where is he?\\n\\npage ten\\n--------\\n\\n   If this real life scenario you\\'ve just read could easily\\nhappen in the Lure of the Temptress, I\\'ll now ask this\\nquestion. Where would Bagpuss be if he were in the world of\\nVirtual Theatre?\\n Give up?\\n   Well, if the Lure Of the Temptress was called Totally\\nImaginary Theatre, you would probably just decide that\\nBagpuss had just \"dissappeared\". Other adventure games are\\nlike \"that\" after all.\\n   However, this game is Virtual Theatre, and things are\\njust a little bit more realistic. People just don\\'t\\ndissappear, and if Bagpuss is not in the courtyard then one\\nof two things must have happened.....\\nhe\\'s either (A) waiting on the other side of the door, or\\n(B) he\\'s taken another exit from the building - an exit\\nwhich leads away from the courtyard and which cannot be seen\\nfrom the window.\\n\\nPage Eleven\\n-----------\\n\\n   So you open the door to find out. Except you can\\'t.\\nBagpuss has obviously locked the door after him. Typical!\\nIn your pockets you find a spare key and so you open the\\ndoor to find out what has happened to Bagpuss. He\\'s not\\nthere but, as you expexted, there is another exit which\\nbypasses the courtyard, so you set off in hot pursuit.\\n   You find yourself in an alleyway. It\\'s empty! Then\\nanother alleyway. Empty. Then you find yourself by a\\nhairdressers. Has Bagpuss gone inside? Or has he taken\\nanother route and gone somewhere totally different, like\\nto buy a pair of new earings from some shady man in a pub?\\n   You\\'ll never catch him now if he has, so you decide to\\nlook inside the hairdressers (after opening the door of\\ncourse) and there is Bagpuss, his hair in rollers and a pina\\ncolada in one hand. He stares at you angrily. Suddenly you\\nfeel like talking about atari st owners, so you decide to\\nretrace your steps and find Stuka and Python again, back at\\nthe cobbled courtyard. But they\\'re not there! The loons!\\nBack you go, into the room you started from, to see if you\\ncan see them from the window. Nope they\\'re gone! What did\\nyou expect though? This is virtual theatre, it\\'s like life.\\n   You can\\'t see something if it isn\\'t there anymore!\\nPage twelve\\n-----------\\n\\n   All the characters involved in the story( and there are\\nmany ) lead little lives of their own. They walk here, the\\nwalk there, they do this, they do that and they talk to\\nother characters, exchanging bits of gossip and\\ninformation....and you, of course, can join in.\\n   But before you dive in wait as i explain who you are,\\nwhere you are, what to do and how to do it!\\n   Read on, mes ames....\\n\\nPage thirteen\\n-------------\\n     PART THREE-WHO ON EARTH AM I?\\n     -----------------------------\\n   You are Diermot, an unwilling hero who\\'d prefer a quiet\\nlife, and are, to all intents and purposes, a good man.\\n   After decades of unrest the king has united the warring\\nfactions in his kingdom and all his lands are at peace. Well\\n,nearly all of them, because there\\'s still one dodgy area\\nleft-a remote region around a town called Turnvale. A revolt\\nhas recently taken place in Turnvale, a revolt orchastrated\\nby an apprentice sorceress called Selena. That\\'s all that is\\nknown!\\n   The king, not very pleased with this, rounds up his\\nfinest horsemen and, with you in tow, they set off for\\nTurnvale.\\n   As night turns to dawn and the riders draw near to\\nTurnvale, the mists rise to reveal not, as expected, a\\npathetic resistance force made up of peasants with\\npitchforks, but an army of grotesque creatures, the likes of\\nwhich have never been seen before. They are, as it happens,\\nhellish mercenary monsters known as the Skorl.\\nPage Forteen\\n------------\\n   The Skorl are all armed to the teeth. The battle which\\nensues is less of a battle and more of a massacre in which\\nthe horsemen are slaughtered and the king is killed. You,\\nhowever, aren\\'t even hurt-well, not much, anyway-you fall\\noff your horse and bang your head on the ground. Everything\\nsuddenly so suidgy in the old braincells. It\\'s almost like\\ngoing to sleep, only a little bit more of the old pain is\\ninvolved. Your lights, as they say, go out!\\npage fifteen\\n------------\\n   PART FOUR. WHERE ON EARTH AM I\\n   ------------------------------\\n   You are gonna be on your own for this. Because due to a\\nprinting error the exact manual i have got hold of has, in\\nfact, got an almost blank page.............\\nPage sixteen\\n------------\\n   i wish there were more blank pages!(stop moaning...ed)\\n\\n   PART FIVE. THE CONTROLS. THE MOUSE.POINT AND CLICK.\\n   ---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTHE MOUSE\\n   Lure Of The Temptress is entirely mouse controlled. On a\\nmouse with three buttons, the middle one is as much use as a\\nlead weight when you\\'re drowning, so forget it exists and\\nconcentrate soley on the left and right buttons.\\nPOINT AND CLICK\\n   Pointing and clicking is easy-peasy and you must be an\\natari user if you think it\\'s how the fonz gets his birds.\\n   You POINT the on-screen pointer to the part of the screen\\nyou wish to interact with, and then you CLICK one of the two\\nbuttons.\\n   From now on i\\'ll be calling the left button Button A and\\nthe right, Button B.\\nHOW TO CONTROL DIERMOT\\n   Diermot can do many things. All you need to know is that\\nthe on-screen pointer, your direct link with the Lure of the\\nTemptress world, changes into different shapes at different\\ntimes and allows you to perform different actions.\\n\\npage seventeen\\n--------------\\n             MOVEMENT\\n             --------\\n\\n      First of all you will want to make Diermot move about\\nin his enviroment, and it couldn\\'t be easier. The mouse\\npointer is generally shown on screen as a little white\\narrow. POINT this to the location you wish to more Diermot\\nto, click BUTTON A, and he will walk there. Don\\'t worry if\\nthere are any objects in his path he is clever enough to go\\naround them.\\n   If there is an exit available from the screen you\\'re on\\nand you point to it, the the small white pointer will change\\ninto a LARGE WHITE ARROW. You can\\'t miss it, it\\'s big and\\nindicates the direction in which you\\'ll be travelling.\\nClick as bove, using BUTTON A, and Diermot will walk to the\\nnext screen.\\npage eighteen\\n-------------\\n               DRINK, EXAMINE, LOOK or STATUS\\n               ------------------------------\\n\\n   This is a menu which you can bring up at any time during\\nthe game simply by moving your pointer anywhere on the\\nscreen( but NOT on a charater or an object) and pressing\\nBUTTON B. If you decide you don\\'t want this menu after all\\nthen simply press BUTTON B again, and the menu will\\ndissapear.If you do wish to use this option then highlight\\nthe option you want and Click BUTTON A.\\n   The options you can choose are as follows;\\n   DRINK\\n      This allows Diermot to drink-water, potions or\\nwhatever. When BUTTON A is clicked on \"drink\" Diermot will\\ntake a swig of whatever liquid he is carrying. If Diermot\\nhas more than one drinkable liquid on his person you will be\\ngiven the option th scroll through them by pushing the mouse\\nbackwards or forewords-one item will be highlighted at a\\ntime. Click on the item you require, using BUTTON A, and\\nDiermot will take a swig.\\n\\n   EXAMINE\\n      Click BUTTON A on this option and a list of everthing\\nthat Diermot is carrying will appear. Scroll through a large\\nlist using the mouse as above. Click BUTTON A on the object\\nof your desire and, hey presto!, a description will appear.\\n\\n   LOOK\\n      Selecting this (BUTTON A) will give you a text\\ndescription on Diermots location. It\\'s not unusual(to be\\nloved by anyone....quit clowning..ed) for a location\\ndescription to include a \"HINT\" of some sort, so I\\'d use\\nthis option fairly regulary if i was me.\\n\\n   STATUS\\n      CLICK on this with BUTTON A and you\\'ll be given an\\ninformation screen which tells you, with no scrolling, of\\nall the objects Diermot is carrying about his person,\\nincluding money.\\n      PLEASE NOTE\\n            At the beginning of the game, when you do not\\npossess and drinks or carry any objects, only LOOK and\\nSTATUS will be available to you.\\n\\nPage nineteen\\n-------------\\n            LOOK AT....(AN OBJECT OR A CHARACTER)\\n   If you move the pointer over a person or a certain object\\nthen the pointer will turn into a small crosshair.\\n   This means you can look at whatever is highlighted, be it\\nhuman, vegatable,or mineral-so CLICK BUTTON A and Diermot\\nwill walk to, and examine, the object in question.\\n   CLICKING BUTTON A again clears the text window containing\\nthe description of the object.\\n\\n           MANIPULATING OBJECTS\\n           --------------------\\n\\n   It\\'s often the case that Diermot is able to manipulate an\\nobject as well as look at it. While the crosshair is\\npositioned over an object, CLICK BUTTON B, and a menu should\\nappear. Move the mouse up and down to scroll through the\\nlist of available commands, then select BUTTON A to select\\nthe required action.\\n   BUTTON B on the other hand will cancel the menu box and\\nreturn you to the main screen.\\npage twenty\\n-----------\\n\\n   LOOKING THROUGH WINDOWS\\n   -----------------------\\n\\n      It\\'s worth mentioning that if  you want to look\\nthrough a crack or a window, you treat it as if you are\\nmanipulating an object. Once your crosshair appears CLICK\\nBUTTON B and you will be offered the option to \"look through\\nthe crack\" or \"look through the window\". Press BUTTON A to\\nselect this action or BUTTON B to cancel. By the way, you\\nCAN\\'T interact with people or objects you see in this\\nmode-all you can do is observe, and pressing either botton\\nwill take you back to your actual location.\\n\\n              TALKING TO PEOPLE\\n              -----------------\\n   Talking to other characters in Lure of the Temptress\\nworks in a similar way to interacting with the objects. Move\\nthe pointer over a character and the pointer will change\\ninto the crosshair sight. At the same time, in the left hand\\ncorner of the screen, the characters name-or their\\ndescription-will appear. Clicking BUTTON A will make Diermot\\nEXAMINE the character, but to talk to them CLICK BUTTON B\\ninstead. A TALK menu will appear allowing you to converse\\nwith the character, ask them for something, give them\\nsomething or in some cases tell them to do something-to\\nissue commands. When characters are engaged in\\nconversation(whether with you,me, or each other) they\\'ll\\nhave a small word balloon above their heads so you\\'ll know.\\n\\npage twentyone\\n--------------\\n\\n             CONVERSING IN GENERAL\\n             ---------------------\\n\\n   I\\'d better explain a little further about the actual\\nconversing, because i hope it\\'s something you\\'ll be doing a\\nlot of in this adventure. Having selected the character you\\nwish to interact with, you then select TALK TO from the TALK\\nmenu i mentioned earlier. One of two things will\\nhappen......\\n\\n   (1) A conversation will unfold in front of your eyes,\\ncontained within dialogue boxes. If you\\'ve read what\\'s been\\nsaid by one character and you want to advance the\\nconversation, then position you pointer over the name at the\\ntop of the dialogue box, and press EITHER BUTTON. (If you do\\nnothing at all then the conversation will advance\\nautomatically after a short period of time anyway.)\\n\\n   (2) When talking to certain characters you may be given a\\nchoice of questions or statements-the relevant lines of text\\nwill appear at the top of the screen. After deciding what\\nyou are going to say(and DO be careful), move the pointer to\\nthe line you have chosen and click BUTTON A. You will\\nimmediately get a response from the other party and may be\\ngiven another list of questions or statements. Do the same,\\nagain and again, until the conversation is terminated. If\\nyou decide that you do not want to continue the conversation\\nat any time then CLICK BUTTON B-the talk option will be\\ncancelled and you will be returned to the main game window.\\n   I recommend that you save your position before you enter\\nin a conversation with the more unsavoury characters.\\n\\nPAGE TWENTYTWO\\n--------------\\n                   ISSUING COMMANDS\\n                   ----------------\\n\\n   If you\\'re talking to certain characters in the game,\\nyou\\'ll notice that the TALK menu contains not just the GIVE,\\nASK and TALK TO commands, but also the TELL command. By\\nusing this TELL command you can get a character to do\\nexactly as you want. ( You can command me, Ratpouch, for\\none-so here\\'s how to make me do things.)\\n   Having Clicked on me and selected TELL in the TALK\\nmenu(with BUTTON A),  the beginning of a sentence appears at\\nthe top of the screen. It says \"TELL Ratpouch to.....\" But\\nto what? Tell me to what? Okay, so you\\'ll notice that a new\\nmenu has opened up, containing a list of verbs which you can\\nscroll through by moving the mouse back and forth. Find one\\nthat you like the look of and highlight it and press BUTTON\\nA. Let\\'s say you picked \"GO TO\", so now the example reads\\n\"TELL RATPOUCH TO GO TO...\" And now the menu has changed to\\na list of locations. How about the sewer outlet? Okay,\\nhighlight it and CLICK BUTTON A.  \"TELL RATPOUCH TO GO TO\\nTHE SEWER OUTLET AND....\" Back comes the verb menu.\\nHighlight  \"GET\". A menu of gettable items appears....choose\\nsewerage. The verb menu reappears....choose drink. A\\ndrinkable menu appears...choose sewerage. Then choose\\n\"return\". Your command now reads \"TELL RATPOUCH TO GO TO THE\\nSEWER OUTLET AND THEN GET SEWERAGE AND THEN DRINK SEWERAGE\\nAND THEN RETURN.\" IF YOU WANT ME TO CARRY OUT THE ORDER,\\nHIGHLIGHT THE WORD \"FINISH\", CLICK BUTTON A, AND OFF I\\'LL\\nTROT TO DO YOUR BIDDING.\\n   If you do not like the choice of options that you have\\nset up use BUTTON B which, upon each click, will backspace\\nthrough the commands allowing you to make corrections.\\n\\n               USE OF THE TELL COMMAND\\n               -----------------------\\n\\n   You will discover some very sophisticated effects using\\nthe \"TELL\" command, and you can save yourself some time to\\nboot-by getting someone like me to to do things for you.\\nOccasionally you may actually need to use the TELL command,\\nfor example when Diermot is unable to carry out an action\\nhimself. At other times the TELL command is necessary\\nbecause although Diermot is capable of doing something, he\\nreally ought to be somewhere else, doing something else.\\n\\nPAGE TWENTYFOUR\\n---------------\\n\\n               GIVING AND TAKING\\n               -----------------\\n\\n   If you CLICK BUTTON A on GIVE in the TALK MENU, it will\\nbe assumed that you want to give something to the character\\nyou have selected, and a menu containing your inventory will\\nbe shown. Scroll through, if necessary, and highlight the\\nobject you wish to get rid of by CLICKING with BUTTON A\\nagain. If the person that you are trying to give the item to\\nwants it then they will take it. If not, they won\\'t.\\n   It\\'s the same process for taking an object from a person.\\nOnce you\\'ve selected a character, highlight ASK in the TALK\\nMENU and then a menu of things you have seen or heard about\\nwill appear. Click on the object you require with BUTTON A\\nand if the person you ask (a) has the object and (b) wants\\nto give it to you, then they will. If they don\\'t, they\\nwon\\'t.\\nPAGE TWENTYFIVE\\n---------------\\n                     MORTAL COMBAT\\n                     -------------\\n\\n   As soon as a combat situation is entered, the pointer\\nsystem will change. The pointer is now displayed as an\\n\"Advance Arrow\", a \"retreat arrow\" or an \"axe icon\"...It all\\ndepends on the positioning of the mouse. Let\\'s do a walk\\nthrough.\\nADVANCE ARROW\\n   If the pointer is in front of Diermots body, you\\'ll get\\nthis, the advance arrow. It still works in the same way as\\nthe pointer insofar as you need to press BUTTON A to make\\nDiermot move. He\\'ll advance.\\nRETREAT ARROW\\n   It\\'s obviously the exact opposite of the advance arrow.\\nIf the pointer is behind Diermot and BUTTON A is pressed\\nthen he will retreat.\\nTHE AXE ICON\\n   This is trickier, because the icon appears in three\\ndifferent locations, depending on the position of the\\npointer. To get the axe icon at all, the pointer has to be\\nover(or very near) Diermot\\'s body. If the pointer is near\\nDiermot\\'s head you\\'ll get the axe icon in a high position.\\nIf the pointer is at Diermot\\'s waist level, you\\'ll get an\\naxe icon in a central position, while if you drag the mouse\\ndown towards Diermot\\'s feet you\\'ll get the axe in a low\\nposition. These three positions are both attack and defend\\npositions. Here\\'s how to use them...\\n   Whether Diermot will attack or defend depends entirely on\\nwhich button is pressed, and which button you press depends\\non what side Diermot is being attacked from.\\n   THE ATTACK BUTTON IS THE BUTTON NEAREST YOUR ENEMY\\n   THE DEFEND BUTTON IS THE BUTTON FURTHEST FROM YOUR ENEMY\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n      TWO MINOR ICONS EXPLAINED IN CASE YOU WET YOUR PANTS\\n\\n   So as not to worry you you should know that an icon of a\\nmovie camera will appear as the machine gets ready to do a\\ngraphic sequence.\\n   Also when you have clicked for Diermot to move somewhere\\na clock icon will appear as the computer thinks out his\\nroute.\\nPAGE TWENTY SEVEN\\n-----------------\\n              SAVING AND LOADING YOUR GAME\\n              ----------------------------\\n\\n   First you\\'ll need to make a data disc. Insert a blank\\ndisc into the drive (DF0) and move your pointer to the top\\nof the screen. A menu bar will appear. Point to FILE, hold\\ndown BUTTON A and select FORMAT DISC, then release the\\nbutton. Press BUTTON A to make a data disc.\\n   If you want to save your position, select SAVE GAME from\\nthe FILE menu, release the BUTTON, then select one of the\\nnine save slots on your data disc. When a slot is empty the\\nname of the slot appears in lower case, and when used it\\nwill cahange to capitals.\\n   To RESTORE a game follow the same procedure, selecting\\nthe required saved position from the list of slots.\\n\\n  TEXT SPEED\\n  __________\\n\\n   I nearly forgot, if you want to change the speed at which\\nthe text is printed on screen simply select the HELP menu\\nfrom the top of the screen. Two options are available: slow\\ntext and fast text.\\n\\nPAGE TWENTYNINE\\n---------------\\n        PART SEVEN-QUICK START REFEREANCE\\n       -----------------------------------\\n\\n   When dealing with the menus the general rule to follow is\\nthat the LEFT BUTTON acts as the selector while the RIGHT\\nBUTTON acts as the deselector.\\n   When the pointer is a small arrow the mouse acts as\\nfollows:\\nLEFT: WALK to the selected spot\\nRIGHT: DRINK, EXAMINE, LOOK, and list STATUS (inventory).\\n   When the pointer is a crosshair:\\nLEFT: EXAMINE object or character.\\nRIGHT: interact with an object.....GET,PULL, etc.\\n       interact with a character...TALK TO, GIVE, TELL, etc.\\nPAGE THIRTY\\n-----------\\n           WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO?\\n          -----------------------\\n   IT\\'S AN ADVENTURE. YOU\\'LL FIND OUT AS YOU GO ALONG. FOR\\nTHOSE WHO ARE NOT HARDENED VETERANS OF ADVENTURE GAMES THERE\\nARE A FEW PAGES OF HINTS TO HELP YOU.\\n\\nPAGE THIRTYONE\\n--------------\\n        HINTS\\n        -----\\n\\nTALK: Talk to everyone. Even boring characters may hold\\nprecious information. But be careful what YOU say....see\\nenemies.\\nLOOK: Some items are obvious, some are not. search your\\nlocations carefully.\\nPEEK: Peek through anything you find peekable. It\\'s handy to\\nfind out things like (a) what people are saying behind your\\nback, or (b) who is or is not in a room before you do\\nsomething, and (c)if you have SEEN an object it will be\\nadded to your noun inventory. You can then ask someone about\\nit even though you have not been in it\\'s actual location.\\nBRIBE: You can be a bit LIBERAL with your cash just before\\nyou ask them a question. But don\\'t be too liberal or you\\'ll\\nhave no cash to be liberal with!\\nHELP: Don\\'t be too proud to ask someone for help. If you\\nthink you can\\'t do something yourself, then maybe you could\\ntalk someone into giving you a hand or, heaven forbid, even\\ndoing it for you.\\nENEMIES: If you\\'re talking to someone and annoy them in some\\nway, it might not end there- they may meet someone on THEIR\\ntravels and relay the incident: \"That Diermot,\" they might\\nsay, \"There\\'s something fishy about him!\" That sort of\\nthing. Rumours and gossip can travel like wildfire, and\\nyou\\'ll be oblivious to it until it\\'s too late.\\nEXAMINE: You\\'ve got an object and can\\'t work out what to do\\nwith it. So examine it. And don\\'t forget it\\'s not only the\\nobjects that you are carrying that can be examined.\\nPAGE THIRTYSIX\\n--------------\\n\\n\\nX-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X\\n Another file downloaded from:                     The NIRVANAnet(tm) Seven\\n\\n & the Temple of the Screaming Electron   Taipan Enigma        510/935-5845\\n Burn This Flag                           Zardoz               408/363-9766\\n realitycheck                             Poindexter Fortran   510/527-1662\\n Lies Unlimited                           Mick Freen           801/278-2699\\n The New Dork Sublime                     Biffnix              415/864-DORK\\n The Shrine                               Rif Raf              206/794-6674\\n Planet Mirth                             Simon Jester         510/786-6560\\n\\n                          \"Raw Data for Raw Nerves\"\\nX-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X\\n'"

ABOUT THIS MANUAL.\\n        ----------------------------\\n\\n   HELLO! My name\\'s Ratpouch, the real star of the game, and\\nat the very beginning of the game I\\'m very near to where\\nyou\\'re pacing around in your cell. Honest! I\\'m that close\\nthat I\\'m in spitting distance-which is very apt as i am the\\nsort of person who usually gets spat at, especially since\\nthe Skorl have come to town. They don\\'t care too much for my\\njokes and this is always getting me into trouble!\\n   The spitting i could take, but being stretched on ye\\nolde rack i just don\\'t find very amusing! Still I don\\'t want\\nto burden you with my troubles-though if you could somehow\\nrescue me i would be paternally grateful.\\n   I\\'d better explain what\\'s going on, and where you come\\nin, or i\\'ll be stuck here forever........\\n   Prepare to enter the village of Turnvale. Prepare\\nyourself for the experience known as virtual theatre!\\n\\nPage nine\\n---------\\n     SO WHAT\\'S THIS \"VIRTUAL THEATRE\" ALL ABOUT?\\n     -------------------------------------------\\n   It\\'s a very good question, and it\\'s one that hasn\\'t been\\nanswered before, because Lure of the Temptress is the first\\nvirtual theatre game ever written.\\n   Imagine for a moment that you are involved in a real life\\nscenario-you\\'re standing in a room which looks out, through\\na window, onto a village courtyard. Yes! A village courtyard\\nwith cobblestones. And let\\'s say that there are three people\\nstanding in the courtyard;Stuka,Python and Bagpuss.\\n If you were to look out of your window you might notice\\nthat Stuka and Python were having a conversation-about, how\\nmany Atari st owners it would take to change a lightbulb?\\nYou might also notice that Bagpuss, who is only interested\\nin not getting his long hair wet,and is not interested in\\nAtari owners, is sauntering towards the building that you\\nare in. Sure enough, he dissappears from the courtyard and\\n\"click\", the door to your right opens. In walks Bagpuss.\\nLet\\'s say that Bagpuss wants to talk to you, about hair wash\\nday or something, then you would turn to face him-as one\\nwould. Once your conversation with Bagpuss is over he turns\\naway from you and, with a flash of golden curls, exits\\nthrough the door, closing it behind him, and, you presume,\\nhas strolled back into the courtyard. So you look through\\nthe window to check and \"horror\" he isn\\'t there! Not a sign\\nof him. The courtyard is Bagpuss-less! Stuka and Python are\\nthere, waffling on about how two Atari st owners linked\\ntheir machines up and made a calculator, but Bagpuss is\\nnowhere to be seen. So where is he?\\n\\npage ten\\n--------\\n\\n   If this real life scenario you\\'ve just read could easily\\nhappen in the Lure of the Temptress, I\\'ll now ask this\\nquestion. Where would Bagpuss be if he were in the world of\\nVirtual Theatre?\\n Give up?\\n   Well, if the Lure Of the Temptress was called Totally\\nImaginary Theatre, you would probably just decide that\\nBagpuss had just \"dissappeared\". Other adventure games are\\nlike \"that\" after all.\\n   However, this game is Virtual Theatre, and things are\\njust a little bit more realistic. People just don\\'t\\ndissappear, and if Bagpuss is not in the courtyard then one\\nof two things must have happened.....\\nhe\\'s either (A) waiting on the other side of the door, or\\n(B) he\\'s taken another exit from the building - an exit\\nwhich leads away from the courtyard and which cannot be seen\\nfrom the window.\\n\\nPage Eleven\\n-----------\\n\\n   So you open the door to find out. Except you can\\'t.\\nBagpuss has obviously locked the door after him. Typical!\\nIn your pockets you find a spare key and so you open the\\ndoor to find out what has happened to Bagpuss. He\\'s not\\nthere but, as you expexted, there is another exit which\\nbypasses the courtyard, so you set off in hot pursuit.\\n   You find yourself in an alleyway. It\\'s empty! Then\\nanother alleyway. Empty. Then you find yourself by a\\nhairdressers. Has Bagpuss gone inside? Or has he taken\\nanother route and gone somewhere totally different, like\\nto buy a pair of new earings from some shady man in a pub?\\n   You\\'ll never catch him now if he has, so you decide to\\nlook inside the hairdressers (after opening the door of\\ncourse) and there is Bagpuss, his hair in rollers and a pina\\ncolada in one hand. He stares at you angrily. Suddenly you\\nfeel like talking about atari st owners, so you decide to\\nretrace your steps and find Stuka and Python again, back at\\nthe cobbled courtyard. But they\\'re not there! The loons!\\nBack you go, into the room you started from, to see if you\\ncan see them from the window. Nope they\\'re gone! What did\\nyou expect though? This is virtual theatre, it\\'s like life.\\n   You can\\'t see something if it isn\\'t there anymore!\\nPage twelve\\n-----------\\n\\n   All the characters involved in the story( and there are\\nmany ) lead little lives of their own. They walk here, the\\nwalk there, they do this, they do that and they talk to\\nother characters, exchanging bits of gossip and\\ninformation....and you, of course, can join in.\\n   But before you dive in wait as i explain who you are,\\nwhere you are, what to do and how to do it!\\n   Read on, mes ames....\\n\\nPage thirteen\\n-------------\\n     PART THREE-WHO ON EARTH AM I?\\n     -----------------------------\\n   You are Diermot, an unwilling hero who\\'d prefer a quiet\\nlife, and are, to all intents and purposes, a good man.\\n   After decades of unrest the king has united the warring\\nfactions in his kingdom and all his lands are at peace. Well\\n,nearly all of them, because there\\'s still one dodgy area\\nleft-a remote region around a town called Turnvale. A revolt\\nhas recently taken place in Turnvale, a revolt orchastrated\\nby an apprentice sorceress called Selena. That\\'s all that is\\nknown!\\n   The king, not very pleased with this, rounds up his\\nfinest horsemen and, with you in tow, they set off for\\nTurnvale.\\n   As night turns to dawn and the riders draw near to\\nTurnvale, the mists rise to reveal not, as expected, a\\npathetic resistance force made up of peasants with\\npitchforks, but an army of grotesque creatures, the likes of\\nwhich have never been seen before. They are, as it happens,\\nhellish mercenary monsters known as the Skorl.\\nPage Forteen\\n------------\\n   The Skorl are all armed to the teeth. The battle which\\nensues is less of a battle and more of a massacre in which\\nthe horsemen are slaughtered and the king is killed. You,\\nhowever, aren\\'t even hurt-well, not much, anyway-you fall\\noff your horse and bang your head on the ground. Everything\\nsuddenly so suidgy in the old braincells. It\\'s almost like\\ngoing to sleep, only a little bit more of the old pain is\\ninvolved. Your lights, as they say, go out!\\npage fifteen\\n------------\\n   PART FOUR. WHERE ON EARTH AM I\\n   ------------------------------\\n   You are gonna be on your own for this. Because due to a\\nprinting error the exact manual i have got hold of has, in\\nfact, got an almost blank page.............\\nPage sixteen\\n------------\\n   i wish there were more blank pages!(stop moaning...ed)\\n\\n   PART FIVE. THE CONTROLS. THE MOUSE.POINT AND CLICK.\\n   ---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTHE MOUSE\\n   Lure Of The Temptress is entirely mouse controlled. On a\\nmouse with three buttons, the middle one is as much use as a\\nlead weight when you\\'re drowning, so forget it exists and\\nconcentrate soley on the left and right buttons.\\nPOINT AND CLICK\\n   Pointing and clicking is easy-peasy and you must be an\\natari user if you think it\\'s how the fonz gets his birds.\\n   You POINT the on-screen pointer to the part of the screen\\nyou wish to interact with, and then you CLICK one of the two\\nbuttons.\\n   From now on i\\'ll be calling the left button Button A and\\nthe right, Button B.\\nHOW TO CONTROL DIERMOT\\n   Diermot can do many things. All you need to know is that\\nthe on-screen pointer, your direct link with the Lure of the\\nTemptress world, changes into different shapes at different\\ntimes and allows you to perform different actions.\\n\\npage seventeen\\n--------------\\n             MOVEMENT\\n             --------\\n\\n      First of all you will want to make Diermot move about\\nin his enviroment, and it couldn\\'t be easier. The mouse\\npointer is generally shown on screen as a little white\\narrow. POINT this to the location you wish to more Diermot\\nto, click BUTTON A, and he will walk there. Don\\'t worry if\\nthere are any objects in his path he is clever enough to go\\naround them.\\n   If there is an exit available from the screen you\\'re on\\nand you point to it, the the small white pointer will change\\ninto a LARGE WHITE ARROW. You can\\'t miss it, it\\'s big and\\nindicates the direction in which you\\'ll be travelling.\\nClick as bove, using BUTTON A, and Diermot will walk to the\\nnext screen.\\npage eighteen\\n-------------\\n               DRINK, EXAMINE, LOOK or STATUS\\n               ------------------------------\\n\\n   This is a menu which you can bring up at any time during\\nthe game simply by moving your pointer anywhere on the\\nscreen( but NOT on a charater or an object) and pressing\\nBUTTON B. If you decide you don\\'t want this menu after all\\nthen simply press BUTTON B again, and the menu will\\ndissapear.If you do wish to use this option then highlight\\nthe option you want and Click BUTTON A.\\n   The options you can choose are as follows;\\n   DRINK\\n      This allows Diermot to drink-water, potions or\\nwhatever. When BUTTON A is clicked on \"drink\" Diermot will\\ntake a swig of whatever liquid he is carrying. If Diermot\\nhas more than one drinkable liquid on his person you will be\\ngiven the option th scroll through them by pushing the mouse\\nbackwards or forewords-one item will be highlighted at a\\ntime. Click on the item you require, using BUTTON A, and\\nDiermot will take a swig.\\n\\n   EXAMINE\\n      Click BUTTON A on this option and a list of everthing\\nthat Diermot is carrying will appear. Scroll through a large\\nlist using the mouse as above. Click BUTTON A on the object\\nof your desire and, hey presto!, a description will appear.\\n\\n   LOOK\\n      Selecting this (BUTTON A) will give you a text\\ndescription on Diermots location. It\\'s not unusual(to be\\nloved by anyone....quit clowning..ed) for a location\\ndescription to include a \"HINT\" of some sort, so I\\'d use\\nthis option fairly regulary if i was me.\\n\\n   STATUS\\n      CLICK on this with BUTTON A and you\\'ll be given an\\ninformation screen which tells you, with no scrolling, of\\nall the objects Diermot is carrying about his person,\\nincluding money.\\n      PLEASE NOTE\\n            At the beginning of the game, when you do not\\npossess and drinks or carry any objects, only LOOK and\\nSTATUS will be available to you.\\n\\nPage nineteen\\n-------------\\n            LOOK AT....(AN OBJECT OR A CHARACTER)\\n   If you move the pointer over a person or a certain object\\nthen the pointer will turn into a small crosshair.\\n   This means you can look at whatever is highlighted, be it\\nhuman, vegatable,or mineral-so CLICK BUTTON A and Diermot\\nwill walk to, and examine, the object in question.\\n   CLICKING BUTTON A again clears the text window containing\\nthe description of the object.\\n\\n           MANIPULATING OBJECTS\\n           --------------------\\n\\n   It\\'s often the case that Diermot is able to manipulate an\\nobject as well as look at it. While the crosshair is\\npositioned over an object, CLICK BUTTON B, and a menu should\\nappear. Move the mouse up and down to scroll through the\\nlist of available commands, then select BUTTON A to select\\nthe required action.\\n   BUTTON B on the other hand will cancel the menu box and\\nreturn you to the main screen.\\npage twenty\\n-----------\\n\\n   LOOKING THROUGH WINDOWS\\n   -----------------------\\n\\n      It\\'s worth mentioning that if  you want to look\\nthrough a crack or a window, you treat it as if you are\\nmanipulating an object. Once your crosshair appears CLICK\\nBUTTON B and you will be offered the option to \"look through\\nthe crack\" or \"look through the window\". Press BUTTON A to\\nselect this action or BUTTON B to cancel. By the way, you\\nCAN\\'T interact with people or objects you see in this\\nmode-all you can do is observe, and pressing either botton\\nwill take you back to your actual location.\\n\\n              TALKING TO PEOPLE\\n              -----------------\\n   Talking to other characters in Lure of the Temptress\\nworks in a similar way to interacting with the objects. Move\\nthe pointer over a character and the pointer will change\\ninto the crosshair sight. At the same time, in the left hand\\ncorner of the screen, the characters name-or their\\ndescription-will appear. Clicking BUTTON A will make Diermot\\nEXAMINE the character, but to talk to them CLICK BUTTON B\\ninstead. A TALK menu will appear allowing you to converse\\nwith the character, ask them for something, give them\\nsomething or in some cases tell them to do something-to\\nissue commands. When characters are engaged in\\nconversation(whether with you,me, or each other) they\\'ll\\nhave a small word balloon above their heads so you\\'ll know.\\n\\npage twentyone\\n--------------\\n\\n             CONVERSING IN GENERAL\\n             ---------------------\\n\\n   I\\'d better explain a little further about the actual\\nconversing, because i hope it\\'s something you\\'ll be doing a\\nlot of in this adventure. Having selected the character you\\nwish to interact with, you then select TALK TO from the TALK\\nmenu i mentioned earlier. One of two things will\\nhappen......\\n\\n   (1) A conversation will unfold in front of your eyes,\\ncontained within dialogue boxes. If you\\'ve read what\\'s been\\nsaid by one character and you want to advance the\\nconversation, then position you pointer over the name at the\\ntop of the dialogue box, and press EITHER BUTTON. (If you do\\nnothing at all then the conversation will advance\\nautomatically after a short period of time anyway.)\\n\\n   (2) When talking to certain characters you may be given a\\nchoice of questions or statements-the relevant lines of text\\nwill appear at the top of the screen. After deciding what\\nyou are going to say(and DO be careful), move the pointer to\\nthe line you have chosen and click BUTTON A. You will\\nimmediately get a response from the other party and may be\\ngiven another list of questions or statements. Do the same,\\nagain and again, until the conversation is terminated. If\\nyou decide that you do not want to continue the conversation\\nat any time then CLICK BUTTON B-the talk option will be\\ncancelled and you will be returned to the main game window.\\n   I recommend that you save your position before you enter\\nin a conversation with the more unsavoury characters.\\n\\nPAGE TWENTYTWO\\n--------------\\n                   ISSUING COMMANDS\\n                   ----------------\\n\\n   If you\\'re talking to certain characters in the game,\\nyou\\'ll notice that the TALK menu contains not just the GIVE,\\nASK and TALK TO commands, but also the TELL command. By\\nusing this TELL command you can get a character to do\\nexactly as you want. ( You can command me, Ratpouch, for\\none-so here\\'s how to make me do things.)\\n   Having Clicked on me and selected TELL in the TALK\\nmenu(with BUTTON A),  the beginning of a sentence appears at\\nthe top of the screen. It says \"TELL Ratpouch to.....\" But\\nto what? Tell me to what? Okay, so you\\'ll notice that a new\\nmenu has opened up, containing a list of verbs which you can\\nscroll through by moving the mouse back and forth. Find one\\nthat you like the look of and highlight it and press BUTTON\\nA. Let\\'s say you picked \"GO TO\", so now the example reads\\n\"TELL RATPOUCH TO GO TO...\" And now the menu has changed to\\na list of locations. How about the sewer outlet? Okay,\\nhighlight it and CLICK BUTTON A.  \"TELL RATPOUCH TO GO TO\\nTHE SEWER OUTLET AND....\" Back comes the verb menu.\\nHighlight  \"GET\". A menu of gettable items appears....choose\\nsewerage. The verb menu reappears....choose drink. A\\ndrinkable menu appears...choose sewerage. Then choose\\n\"return\". Your command now reads \"TELL RATPOUCH TO GO TO THE\\nSEWER OUTLET AND THEN GET SEWERAGE AND THEN DRINK SEWERAGE\\nAND THEN RETURN.\" IF YOU WANT ME TO CARRY OUT THE ORDER,\\nHIGHLIGHT THE WORD \"FINISH\", CLICK BUTTON A, AND OFF I\\'LL\\nTROT TO DO YOUR BIDDING.\\n   If you do not like the choice of options that you have\\nset up use BUTTON B which, upon each click, will backspace\\nthrough the commands allowing you to make corrections.\\n\\n               USE OF THE TELL COMMAND\\n               -----------------------\\n\\n   You will discover some very sophisticated effects using\\nthe \"TELL\" command, and you can save yourself some time to\\nboot-by getting someone like me to to do things for you.\\nOccasionally you may actually need to use the TELL command,\\nfor example when Diermot is unable to carry out an action\\nhimself. At other times the TELL command is necessary\\nbecause although Diermot is capable of doing something, he\\nreally ought to be somewhere else, doing something else.\\n\\nPAGE TWENTYFOUR\\n---------------\\n\\n               GIVING AND TAKING\\n               -----------------\\n\\n   If you CLICK BUTTON A on GIVE in the TALK MENU, it will\\nbe assumed that you want to give something to the character\\nyou have selected, and a menu containing your inventory will\\nbe shown. Scroll through, if necessary, and highlight the\\nobject you wish to get rid of by CLICKING with BUTTON A\\nagain. If the person that you are trying to give the item to\\nwants it then they will take it. If not, they won\\'t.\\n   It\\'s the same process for taking an object from a person.\\nOnce you\\'ve selected a character, highlight ASK in the TALK\\nMENU and then a menu of things you have seen or heard about\\nwill appear. Click on the object you require with BUTTON A\\nand if the person you ask (a) has the object and (b) wants\\nto give it to you, then they will. If they don\\'t, they\\nwon\\'t.\\nPAGE TWENTYFIVE\\n---------------\\n                     MORTAL COMBAT\\n                     -------------\\n\\n   As soon as a combat situation is entered, the pointer\\nsystem will change. The pointer is now displayed as an\\n\"Advance Arrow\", a \"retreat arrow\" or an \"axe icon\"...It all\\ndepends on the positioning of the mouse. Let\\'s do a walk\\nthrough.\\nADVANCE ARROW\\n   If the pointer is in front of Diermots body, you\\'ll get\\nthis, the advance arrow. It still works in the same way as\\nthe pointer insofar as you need to press BUTTON A to make\\nDiermot move. He\\'ll advance.\\nRETREAT ARROW\\n   It\\'s obviously the exact opposite of the advance arrow.\\nIf the pointer is behind Diermot and BUTTON A is pressed\\nthen he will retreat.\\nTHE AXE ICON\\n   This is trickier, because the icon appears in three\\ndifferent locations, depending on the position of the\\npointer. To get the axe icon at all, the pointer has to be\\nover(or very near) Diermot\\'s body. If the pointer is near\\nDiermot\\'s head you\\'ll get the axe icon in a high position.\\nIf the pointer is at Diermot\\'s waist level, you\\'ll get an\\naxe icon in a central position, while if you drag the mouse\\ndown towards Diermot\\'s feet you\\'ll get the axe in a low\\nposition. These three positions are both attack and defend\\npositions. Here\\'s how to use them...\\n   Whether Diermot will attack or defend depends entirely on\\nwhich button is pressed, and which button you press depends\\non what side Diermot is being attacked from.\\n   THE ATTACK BUTTON IS THE BUTTON NEAREST YOUR ENEMY\\n   THE DEFEND BUTTON IS THE BUTTON FURTHEST FROM YOUR ENEMY\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n      TWO MINOR ICONS EXPLAINED IN CASE YOU WET YOUR PANTS\\n\\n   So as not to worry you you should know that an icon of a\\nmovie camera will appear as the machine gets ready to do a\\ngraphic sequence.\\n   Also when you have clicked for Diermot to move somewhere\\na clock icon will appear as the computer thinks out his\\nroute.\\nPAGE TWENTY SEVEN\\n-----------------\\n              SAVING AND LOADING YOUR GAME\\n              ----------------------------\\n\\n   First you\\'ll need to make a data disc. Insert a blank\\ndisc into the drive (DF0) and move your pointer to the top\\nof the screen. A menu bar will appear. Point to FILE, hold\\ndown BUTTON A and select FORMAT DISC, then release the\\nbutton. Press BUTTON A to make a data disc.\\n   If you want to save your position, select SAVE GAME from\\nthe FILE menu, release the BUTTON, then select one of the\\nnine save slots on your data disc. When a slot is empty the\\nname of the slot appears in lower case, and when used it\\nwill cahange to capitals.\\n   To RESTORE a game follow the same procedure, selecting\\nthe required saved position from the list of slots.\\n\\n  TEXT SPEED\\n  __________\\n\\n   I nearly forgot, if you want to change the speed at which\\nthe text is printed on screen simply select the HELP menu\\nfrom the top of the screen. Two options are available: slow\\ntext and fast text.\\n\\nPAGE TWENTYNINE\\n---------------\\n        PART SEVEN-QUICK START REFEREANCE\\n       -----------------------------------\\n\\n   When dealing with the menus the general rule to follow is\\nthat the LEFT BUTTON acts as the selector while the RIGHT\\nBUTTON acts as the deselector.\\n   When the pointer is a small arrow the mouse acts as\\nfollows:\\nLEFT: WALK to the selected spot\\nRIGHT: DRINK, EXAMINE, LOOK, and list STATUS (inventory).\\n   When the pointer is a crosshair:\\nLEFT: EXAMINE object or character.\\nRIGHT: interact with an object.....GET,PULL, etc.\\n       interact with a character...TALK TO, GIVE, TELL, etc.\\nPAGE THIRTY\\n-----------\\n           WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO?\\n          -----------------------\\n   IT\\'S AN ADVENTURE. YOU\\'LL FIND OUT AS YOU GO ALONG. FOR\\nTHOSE WHO ARE NOT HARDENED VETERANS OF ADVENTURE GAMES THERE\\nARE A FEW PAGES OF HINTS TO HELP YOU.\\n\\nPAGE THIRTYONE\\n--------------\\n        HINTS\\n        -----\\n\\nTALK: Talk to everyone. Even boring characters may hold\\nprecious information. But be careful what YOU say....see\\nenemies.\\nLOOK: Some items are obvious, some are not. search your\\nlocations carefully.\\nPEEK: Peek through anything you find peekable. It\\'s handy to\\nfind out things like (a) what people are saying behind your\\nback, or (b) who is or is not in a room before you do\\nsomething, and (c)if you have SEEN an object it will be\\nadded to your noun inventory. You can then ask someone about\\nit even though you have not been in it\\'s actual location.\\nBRIBE: You can be a bit LIBERAL with your cash just before\\nyou ask them a question. But don\\'t be too liberal or you\\'ll\\nhave no cash to be liberal with!\\nHELP: Don\\'t be too proud to ask someone for help. If you\\nthink you can\\'t do something yourself, then maybe you could\\ntalk someone into giving you a hand or, heaven forbid, even\\ndoing it for you.\\nENEMIES: If you\\'re talking to someone and annoy them in some\\nway, it might not end there- they may meet someone on THEIR\\ntravels and relay the incident: \"That Diermot,\" they might\\nsay, \"There\\'s something fishy about him!\" That sort of\\nthing. Rumours and gossip can travel like wildfire, and\\nyou\\'ll be oblivious to it until it\\'s too late.\\nEXAMINE: You\\'ve got an object and can\\'t work out what to do\\nwith it. So examine it. And don\\'t forget it\\'s not only the\\nobjects that you are carrying that can be examined.\\nPAGE THIRTYSIX\\n--------------\\n\\n\\nX-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X\\n Another file downloaded from:                     The NIRVANAnet(tm) Seven\\n\\n & the Temple of the Screaming Electron   Taipan Enigma        510/935-5845\\n Burn This Flag                           Zardoz               408/363-9766\\n realitycheck                             Poindexter Fortran   510/527-1662\\n Lies Unlimited                           Mick Freen           801/278-2699\\n The New Dork Sublime                     Biffnix              415/864-DORK\\n The Shrine                               Rif Raf              206/794-6674\\n Planet Mirth                             Simon Jester         510/786-6560\\n\\n                          \"Raw Data for Raw Nerves\"\\nX-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-X\\n'\n"
